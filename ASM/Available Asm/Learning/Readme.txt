2 files are included for this patch:
Auto Learning - If blue magic is cast, the player is guaranteed to learn it under any circumstances
Easy Learning - If blue magic is cast, the player must have 1 character with learning who does not have the following conditions:

1. Removed from party (such as during the Pyramid and Fork Tower)
2. Jumping
3. Suffering from any of the following statuses:

Status 0 (curable)
40 Stone
20 Toad
10 Mini
02 Zombie
01 Darkness

Status 1 (temporary)
40 Sleep
20 Paralyze
10 Charm
08 Berserk

Status 2 (dispellable)
10 Stop

Status 3 (special)
80 Erased
20 Controlled (will only cast Fire Sword)
04 Singing

There are 4 differences between the Easy Learning patch and the original game:
1. As stated above, statuses can prevent learning from occurring
2. Blue Magic that misses (especially important for spells like Level 5 Death) can be learned
3. The target of the Blue Magic doesn't matter (important for monsters you control or confuse to use Blue Magic on themselves such as Red Dragons and their Level 3 Flare)
4. Because of #3, only 1 character in your party needs learning in order to learn Blue Magic. There is no need to give it to everyone unless you are worried about status effects blocking it.
