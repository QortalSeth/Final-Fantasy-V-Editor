To apply ASM patches do the following:
1. Move desired patches from "Available Asm" to "Applied Asm" folders
2. Place ROM named "Final Fantasy V" in same directory as this document
3. If ROM is headered, change its file extension to .smc, if unheadered, change it to .sfc
   a. This must be done so that the Asar compiler writes the values to the correct locations
   b. To change the file extension, simply rename the file with the correct extension.
   c. Ignore any warnings from your operating system about changing the file extension
4. Execute "Final Fantasy V.bat" and all asm files in the "Applied asm" directory will be applied to your ROM.
